 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is the amount of time taken by a
		program to run and execute the tasks. Programmers tries to 
		reduce the time complexity by optmizing the code making
		it more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> is the amount of space taken by a 
		program. If n is the size of the array then space complexity
		of the program is O(n)</p>
