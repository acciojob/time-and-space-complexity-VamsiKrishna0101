 <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time Complexity is the amount of time taken by a program to run and execute the tasks. Programmers truis to reduce the time complexity by optmizing the code makeing it more efficient</p>
	<p><b>'Space Complexity'</b> is the amount of space taken by a program. If n is the size of the array then space complexity of the program is o(n)</p>
